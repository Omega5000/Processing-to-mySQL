# Processing-to-mySQL
Sending Data from Processing (Java) to mySQL using PHP and then parsing it with JSON and exporting it to Javascript using jQuery's AJAX.

You will need a webserver with MySQL and PHP installed on it. Make sure you have backed up your data before using this code.
If you are using this repository, make sure you have a basic understanding of MySQL, PHP, JS and Java.

You will need to install the HTTP Request Processing library by Rune and Shiffman along with the Processing NET library.
It is highly recommended to also install PHPMyAdmin on your server in order to interact with your database, and in helping understanding the query language.

Note: Make sure that the data id that you're sending from Processing to your server (in our case Atak, Proeflokaal, etc.) is the same as the row names in your database.
